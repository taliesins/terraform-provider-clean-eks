description: |-
  A provider to bootstrap an EKS cluster by removing AWS CNI and Kube-Proxy. It will also add the required annotations and labels to CoreDNS so that Helm can manage CoreDNS. It will also drop managed by AWS labels from CoreDNS deployment and service.

# CleanEKS Provider

The CleanEKS Provider can be used to configure a clean EKS cluster.

When an EKS cluster is created by default AWS CNI, Kube Proxy and CoreDNS are configured for the cluster. This is
done to make the process of using EKS simplier. When using IaC tools this causes problems, as our desired state is
to remove created resources. This provider aims to solve that problem.

In more advanced scenario's you might want to replace AWS CNI that is used with something like Cilium CNI. To get
the full power of Cilium we would want to replace instead of chain Cilium on top of AWS CNI and using Kube Proxy.

The other scenario where this provider is useful is if you want to manage these components yourself with something
like Helm. A pattern that is often followed is called App of Apps, where there is an umbrella Helm chart that calls
all the other helm charts required. Mixing this with a Kubernetes native deployment system like ArgoCD allows a
very easy way to administer a Kubernetes cluster using GitOps.

For example using ArgoCD application CRD to define the core App of Apps for a cluster. So to update CoreDNS you
would update the Helm Chart version in Git and ArgoCD would detect the change and roll out the new version of
CoreDNS. It could also be used to override Helm Chart values for example to configure automatic scaling of CoreDNS
which is **not enabled** by default by AWS.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "cleaneks" {
  host                   = data.aws_eks_cluster.cluster.endpoint
  cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(data.aws_eks_cluster.cluster.certificate_authority[0].data)
  token                  = data.aws_eks_cluster_auth.cluster.token
}

module "eks" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"

  enable_cluster_creator_admin_permissions = true # if this is disabled then the deployment user cannot work inside kubernetes cluster
}

data "aws_eks_cluster" "cluster" {
  name       = module.eks.cluster_name
  depends_on = [module.eks]
}

data "aws_eks_cluster_auth" "cluster" {
  name       = module.eks.cluster_name
  depends_on = [module.eks]
}
```
